# Nobel-Prize-Winners-dataDNA-challenge-
This is my entry for the #may 2022 challenge by onyx data     
For this challenge we analyzed the Nobel prize winners dataset from 1901 - 2019         
For my analysis I used Microsoft SQL Server and Microsoft Power BI        

### For Microsoft SQL server             
I queried the dataset for the following information:      
1) country of birth with most award won in each category
2) laureates total prize's won and list of categories
3) universities and total prize won
4) total number of laureates
5) total number of winners in each category
6) first prize winners in each category
7) recent prize winners in each category
8) gender distribution in each category

### For Power BI           
I did some data cleaning on the dataset,    
Did some data modelling     
And I created an interactive dashboard.       
first look at the dashboard represent the entire information from 1901 - 2019 and from all 6 categories       
when filtered by chemistry category, the dashboard would represent all information from 1901 - 2019 for chemistry category alone.     

This project was fun and I gained a lot of knowledge working on something with no prior information unlike my previous projects where I get to watch tutorials.
